Upon arrival from Australia, they met with              and leaned the needs of the MIT undergraduate community. They fully              integrated into all social events. During Friday Visiting Scholar              nights, they introduced the students to the products of the Australian              film industry in a series of events that became increasingly well              attended, thus providing the program with its momentum. Their consistency              in putting on events on Friday evenings helped make the program              become a routine event. They became amongst the most visible members              the Simmons Hall community.</p>          <p>Hayden received his Ph.D. in Offshore Engineering at Monash University,            Australia.

She is an Assistant Professor            (tenured) in the            Departament of Materials Engineering,            Instituto Superior T&eacute;cnico,            Technical University of Lisbon. Patricia obtained her PhD in Applied            Physics at the University of Groningen, The Netherlands, where she            lived from 1997 to 2001 and made dear friends from all over the world.            She is a trained electron microscopist and her interests have been            centered on materials characterization at the atomic and nano scales.            Contact and collaboration with researchers from the biology and biotechnology            fields led her to perceive that the techniques involved in materials            characterization can also be used to investigate cells and biological            tissues. Furthermore, the approaches used in materials science lead            to new (and quantitative) insights into biological observations.            Fulfilling her new scientific interests she is now, while on sabbatical            leave, a visiting scholar at the Department of Materials Science            and Engineering, working with Dean Subra Suresh on cell and molecular            mechanics of human diseases, with a focus on malaria.</p>          <p>Patricia's interests and hobbies include DIY (fabricating or repairing            things for home needs); living around the world whenever possible;            reading (nowadays evolutionary psychology with enthousiasm); cinema            (too little time, too many movies to watch); making friends and going            out. Patricia is a founding member of Vigia (The Lookout) Club, a            group of friends of the ?White Sand Beach? 60 km to the north of            Lisbon in Portugal.</p>          <p>    <a href="http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=referer"><img        src="http://www.w3.org/Icons/valid-xhtml10-blue" border="0"        alt="Valid XHTML 1.0 Transitional" height="31" width="88" /> </a><a href="http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/check/referer">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img style="border:0;width:88px;height:31px"        src="http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/images/vcss-blue"        alt="Valid CSS!" /></a></p>  </td></tr></table></body></html>
