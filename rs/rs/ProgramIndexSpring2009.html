People, including        a number of babies and children that had received the drug heparin, were        dying of mysterious and horrific allergic reactions. Heparin is a seven        billion dollar a year drug used in dialysis machines. It is also administered        directly into patients after they have had surgery to prevent unwanted        blood coagulation. Heparin is a drug that has been used safely for many        years, but something happened last year to the heparin supply that was        killing people. </p>      <p>The US FDA, CDC and industry approached MIT Professor Ram Sasisekharan        to help identify the contaminant. The story begins with the invention        of a tool for sequencing heparin and figuring out what the contaminant        was. Much to the surprise of everyone, the contaminant appears to have        been added to the drug supply intentionally. </p>      <p>Come hear a 30 minute talk (not overly technical) about the detective        work that led to restoration of the quality of the Global heparin supply.        You will also hear of the political tensions that arose between the US        Congress and a foreign power over the role of lax regulatory policy in        that nation in the deaths of Americans and others around the world. </p>      <p>Ram Sasisekharan is a professor in the Department of Biological Engineering    and the Director of the Harvard-MIT Division of Health Sciences and Technology.</p></td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td align="right" valign="top"><p><a href="Images/2009-04-03-memento.jpg"><img src="thumbnails/2009-04-03-memento.jpg" alt="Memento Poster" width="200" height="264" border="0" /></a></p>    <p>&nbsp;</p></td>    <td valign="top" class="content"><h3>Memento</h3>      <p>Friday, April 3, 2009</p>      <p>Organizers: Steven Hall, John Hecker, Reuben Goodman, Retsina Meyer </p>      <p>Leonard (Guy Pearce) is an insurance        investigator whose         memory has been damaged following a head injury he sustained after         intervening on his wife's murder. His quality of life has been         severely hampered after this event, and he can now only live a         comprehendable life by tattooing notes on himself and taking pictures        with a Polaroid camera. Leonard badly wants revenge for his wife's murder,        but, as numerous characters explain, there may be little point if he        won't remember it in order to provide closure for him.

Saramago's novel begins with the sudden &quot;white        blindness&quot; of a driver stopped at a red light. From then on, each        person the man encounters (the not-so-good Samaritan who drives him home,        the man's wife, the ophthalmologist, the patients waiting to see the        ophthalmologist) becomes blind. The white blindness plague sets off panic.        The government interns the blind in a mental hospital guarded by soldiers        with orders to shoot anyone who tries to escape. As order at the mental        hospital breaks down, the depraved overpower the decent. When the hospital        is consumed in flames, the fleeing internees find that everyone has gone        blind. Sightless people rove in packs, scavenging for food, sleeping        wherever they can. Throughout the narrative, one character remains sighted,        the ophthalmologist's wife. Claiming to be blind so she is interned with        her husband, she eventually becomes the guide and protector for an impromptu        family. She is the reader's guide and repository of human decency.</p>      <p>&nbsp;</p></td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td align="right" valign="top"><p><a href="Images/2009-02-20 Tea.jpg"><img src="thumbnails/2009-02-20 Tea.jpg" alt="Tea Tasting Poster" width="200" height="259" border="0" /></a></p>        <p>&nbsp;</p></td>    <td valign="top" class="content"><h3> The Fine Art of Tea: An Evening of        Tea Tasting with Residential Scholar Tenzin Priyadarshi</h3>        <p> February 20, 2009</p>      <p>Organizers: Tenzin Priyadarshi, Danielle Hinton </p>      <p>Join us for an evening exploring the world of Tea (of course, you get        to try some too!).

He has trained three mongooses to work in        conjunction with a robot to literally sniff out the mines. Once a mine        is spotted, the mongoose will stand up on its hind legs to signal the        location of the mine, and then the metal detector of the robot will perform        additional confirmation. In an initial test run on a 10 x 10 meter plot,        the mongoose-robot duo found every mine. Thrishantha Nanayakkara is currently        a Radcliffe Fellow at Harvard where he is perfecting his work.
