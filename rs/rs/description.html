The            program is mostly (but not exclusively) populated by faculty members            on sabbatical leaves from other institutions, by artists, or by industrial            professionals visiting MIT for an extended period of time. Since            its inception in 2003, the social and educational element of the            Residential Scholars program has been funded by the scholarly allowance            associated with the William and Betsy Leitch Professorship which            is held by John Essigmann, who with Ellen Essigmann are Housemasters            of Simmons Hall.</p>          <p>The MIT Residential Scholars Program is based on Simmons Hall, a            spectacular residence designed by Steven Holl and completed in 2002.            Simmons Hall houses a diverse constituency of 340 undergraduate students.            As MIT&rsquo;s newest undergraduate residence, Simmons Hall was designed            with many common spaces intended to host a variety of community events.            In addition, Simmons Hall was provided with five apartments for visitors            that would allow the establishment of the Residential Scholars program.            For these reasons, the Residential Scholars program is based at Simmons            Hall but it really belongs to the entire residential system at MIT. </p>          <p>Our expectations for Residential Scholars is that they (and their            family members if they come to live at Simmons) become active members            of the Simmons community by participating with significant frequency            in dorm functions (such as celebrations, entertainment events, study            breaks, holiday brunches), by dining with some regularity at the            dining hall, and by organizing events that are designed to engage            a broad section of the MIT community. In addition, working with the            permanent House Team, we expect each scholar to take a lead in organizing            two to three events per semester. These typically take place on Friday            evenings, between 6 and 8 p.m. We have a wealth of spaces that can            be used, depending on the nature of the event. Our Multipurpose Room            holds about 200 people. We have other cozier spaces, including our            Country Kitchen, which can be used to host cooking events. Most events            are advertised throughout the broad MIT residential community. </p>          <p>Successful Residential Scholars events come in all forms. Venerable            Tenzin Priyadarshi, an RS since 2003, organizes meditation sessions            with some regularity. He also put together a film festival dealing            with India and Tibet. In 2004, 2005 and 2007, he coordinated the            construction of a Sand Mandala, each one attended by several thousands            of people. He has also given many lectures on various topics. Barbara            Louviere and Marshall Michel have taken students to some of the major            exhibits at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, have organized a Vietnam            War film festival, and helped in bringing together musicians from            New Orleans displaced by Hurricane Katrina for a benefit concert            at MIT.</p>          <p>Residential Scholars events can also be small and intimate: dinner            conversations with the scholars or their guests, cooking classes            for a small group (these are always very successful), career advice            type sessions, talks on topics of general interest, etc. Overly academic            events tend not to be well received. Part of the challenge is to            conceive exciting events that include some meaningful but slightly            under cover educational content. The goal of this program is to broaden            the horizons of our students in a non-academic setting.</p>          <p>The Residential Scholars program at Simmons Hall is managed by Prof.            Steven Hall, the Simmons Hall Associate Housemaster, who can be contacted            at <a href="mailto:srhall@mit.edu">srhall@mit.edu</a>. </p>          <p>&nbsp;</p>          <p>    <a href="http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=referer"><img        src="http://www.w3.org/Icons/valid-xhtml10"        alt="Valid XHTML 1.0 Transitional" height="31" width="88" /></a>  </p>    </td></tr></table></body></html>
