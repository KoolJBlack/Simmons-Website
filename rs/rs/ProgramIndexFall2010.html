He will explore the          ways in which technology and social media offer ground breaking opportunities          for creating a new normalcy to local and global peace-making and reconciliation,          and how this expands our understanding of the inter-connectedness of          all people with implications for reframing the landscape of power dynamics          among diverse peoples.
