        <p class="p2">As term is starting again, I'd just like to remind you
          all that the House Fee for printer usage is being applied again this
          term. This policy was approved by the House last semester.</p>
        <p class="p2">What this is:</p>
        <p class="p2">Each <span class="i3">week</span> you're allowed to print
          <span class="i3">40 pages</span> (combined both to simmons and
          waffle). A double-sided page is considered 2 pages, as it uses as
          much toner as 2 single-sheet pages.</p>
        <p class="p2"><span class="i3">Each page after 40 will cost you
          $0.25</span></p>
        <p class="p2">This is because we as a dorm are responsible for running
          and stocking the printers here in the building.</p>
        <p class="p2">Also if you have large amount of things to print, you can
          print them to Athena (not the one in Simmons, those are our printers)
          You can print to the free athena printers as much as you like, and
          you can do so from your room and pick it up on your way to class
          (look up KLPR on the web).</p>
        <p class="p2">This is not meant to be overly strict, and if you're over
          just a little one week, but haven't printed much in a while, we'll
          take that into consideration.</p>
        <p class="p2">If you have any dorm related print projects that you need
          to print for Simmons itself, those pages won't count with proper
          notification. Please email
          <span id="email_facilities_dorm">simmons-facilities</span> if you
          have a situation like that.</p>
        <script type="text/javascript">
          make_addr_span("email_facilities_dorm","mit","edu",
                         "simmons-facilities");
        </script>
        <p class="p2">If the printer breaks and spews out many pages of garbage
          from your account, please cancel the print job (button on printer)
          and let us know, you won't be charged for that either.</p>
