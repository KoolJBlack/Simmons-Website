	      <li>A Simmons Hall Space Reservation Application needs
	        to be completed and delivered to the reservation chair
	        before an event takes place if the event is registered
	        through MIT, the group is paying a fee, there is a
	        moderate risk of damage, or the reservation chair
	        wants a written agreement.  If no MIT account number
	        is available, a deposit of $200 is required.</li>
	      <li>If MIT registration is required, the group must
	        complete this process before the event.</li>
	    </ol></li>
	  <li>Notices
	    <ol>
	      <li>A list of reservations should be posted online and
	        at desk.  Reasonable effort should be made to ensure
	        that the notices are current.</li>
	    </ol></li>
	</ol>
	<p class="p2">These are guidelines and will not cover every
          eventuality.  The Reservation Chair and Committee should use
          their best judgment or consult the House Committee when
          these bylaws are insufficient.</p>
